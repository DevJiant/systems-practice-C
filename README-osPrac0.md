# systems-practice-C

README - osPrac0 

For this program, some operating systems principles in C are highlighted for praticing and developing optimized
approaches to analyzing and simulating memory and data processing for conceptualized scenarios. 

The program provides flexibility in altering key parameters necessary for varying testing objectives.

After running the program in terminal, a console output should be produced similar to the one below:

As well as a csv file with the simulation data in the root directory where the program is stored.

From there, many inferences can be made by the data written in the newly created file. In this case,
Microsoft Excel was used to visualize the data from each sequence process categorized by scenario, for 
instance, scenario 3:

From visualizing the data, we can see which sequences have characteristics for desired system needs. We can
infer assumptions about the sequence's processing limits, points of optimal output, and areas of weakness in the program
when processing different types and amounts of data during different scenarios.
